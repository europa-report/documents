## Background
Reddit is a social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website, recently including livestream content through Reddit Public Access Network. Registered members submit content to the site such as links, text posts, and images, which are then voted up or down by other members. A subreddit is a specific online community, and the posts associated with it, on the social media website Reddit. Subreddit's are dedicated to a particular topic that people write about, and they're denoted by /r/, followed by the subreddit's name, e.g., /r/gaming.

## Project Description
The project serves to provide a statistical analysis to show the increase or decline of subreddit and content information per day. The project will assist us with the conclusion of whether the online presence on the Internet communities are growing or reducing per day.

## Project Requirement
- 24/7 Shared Server
- Relational Database 
- API Queries
- Object-Oriented Programming Language 

## Business Rules
- A day is between 12:00 PM - 11:59 AM.
- Cron's job execute python file to retrieve data from Reddit's API.
- Store to the local database.
- User load up the web-page, Nodejs load data to the React's component.
- User Interface will display the chart of data.

## Technologies Used
- Back-end
     - **MySQL/MariaDB**
     - **NodeJS**
     - **ExpressJS**
- Front-end 
     -  **React.js** 
     -  **BootStrap**
- GitHub
    - GitHub URL: https://github.com/europa-report 

## Design Patterns
- **Model, View, Controller (MVC)**
  - Model (Nodejs) is responsible for represent data.
  - Controller (Nodejs) is responsible for manipulation of data.
  - View (React) displays data to the GUI.
- **Single Page Application (SPA)**
  - The single page application design pattern will fit all the interactive and swapping data will be in a single page.
- **Proxy**
  - This proxy design pattern will be using python as proxy to retrieve data from Reddit's api.
- **Observer**
  - The observer design pattern will be using socket.io and react hook as event listener.
- **Composition**
  - The composition design pattern will be using the React's Component to generate another component.

## Layering 

### Server-side Layers

#### Service Layer: **Python** & **Crontab Job**
  - This layer will include Python and Crontab Job tools.
  - The responsibility of this layer is to maintain data consistency. For each new day, the crontab job will be executed which will make an API request from the source containing the data and breaking them down to be organized. The organized data will be selectively passed to the data layer.

#### Data Layer: **MySQL/MariaDB**
  - This layer will include the MySQL/MariaDB database tool and the Reddit API functionality. 
  - Once the data is passed from the service layer, the data will add a new record along with newly made unique identifier to be the primary key and a date of when the information was collected and data to be followed afterwards.  
  - The responsibilities of this layer will be store the collected data from the service layer and pass collected data to the business layer. 

#### Business Layer: **NodeJS** & **ExpressJS**
  - This layer will act as the controller for the presentation layer.
  - Using NodeJS and ExpressJS to represent and manipulate data. 


### Client-side Layers

#### Presentation Layer: **React.js**
  -  This layer will allow the user to search queries and display the chart of datas from a web browser

Our team will keep the user interface separated from the back-end by using the tactic Separate User Interface, which will allow changes to be made easier.

## Glossary

* __Subreddit__ - A Subreddit is a sub community within Reddit. It usually follows a well-defined theme and people interested in the topic/theme can join it to share content with other members of the community.

* __Redditor__ - A Reddit user.

* __Upvote__ - It is vote used to show agreement with a comment or a post.

* __Downvote__ - A vote used to show disagreement with a comment or a post.

* __Comment__ - A response to a post or another comment.

* __Post__ - A post constitutes one of the following: A link to an external source, a cross-post which links to another post, rich media, or pain text.


## Current System

Reddit in its current form can be rather infuriating to use. Any edit made to a comment or a post is hidden and the original content cannot be seen again. It is also hard to visualize a lot of user generated data like votes due to Reddit's various obfuscation rules on it's frontend. It's API is also very cluttered and hard to use for the purpose of research.


## Goals

Our overall goal is to make a new facade for Reddit with archival features and a better but with selected subreddit communities, more uniform API. This is how we plan to accomplish it:

* ~~Goal #1: Accumulate and track the numbers of the subreddit communities from the beginning of semester to the end of the semester by each day.~~
* Revised Goal #1: Each member of the group will select the 2 subreddit communities to use for this course.
* Goal #2: Accumulate and track the numbers of the users in the selected subreddit communities from the beginning of semester to the end of the semester by each day.
* Goal #3: Accumulate and track the numbers of the posts in the selected subreddit communities from the beginning of semester to the end of the semester by each day.
* Goal #4: Identify the factors supporting the growth or decline of selected subreddit communities.
* Goal #5: Create a consistent real-time data visualization.


## Stakeholders

* Data scientists
    * We plan to tailor our exposed API and front-end to fit the needs of people in this field so minimal work is required to extract relevant information.


## Scope

* An ETL script that will fetch data from reddit every day.
* A NodeJS backend for our API to connect to the database.
* A ReactJS front-end for users to interact with the API.


## Anticipated Input

* JSON

## Processing

* A diff utility will be used to create low cost archives of content in our database.
* Any user input will be cleaned and standardized in accordance with Reddit's markdown before being stored in our database.
* Searches will be based on time, tags, and votes.


## Anticipated Output

* JSON


## Data Sources

* [Reddit API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/) 

## Tech Stack

* ReactJS
* NodeJS
* ExpressJS
* MySQL/MariaDB
* Python

            return
    }
}
```

##### JS Description

We choose to handle our exceptions on the server-side and client-side with two parameters, error type and message, which helps us to handle responsibilities within the class. Anytime an error is caught, an error message will will be logged to the console and the detailed information will be stored in the error.log file in the log directory of the server. If the content was not found, the result is empty or any changes failed to update, they will also be logged. We recognize that if an exception handling was revealed to the malicious users, the malicious users will exploit that endpoint vulnerability and the security would be compromised. We will expand on the presentation layer to provide our own generic error codes to inform the user that something has occurred and to deliver the error code to the developer for them to repeat the steps the user made and resolve that vulnerability as soon as possible.


##### Python Exception Handling Snippets
- baseSQL.py
```python
username = "root"
password = "students"
hostname = "localhost"
database = "subreddit_db"

try:
    databaseVar = mysql.connector.connect(
        host=hostname,
        user=username,
        password=password,
        database=database
    )
except:
    print("Database Connection Failed")
    exit(2)
```

- get_call.py
```python
try:
    import baseAPI
except:
    print("baseAPI.py file not found. ")
    exit(1)

try:
    import baseSQL
except:
    print("baseSQL.py file not found.")
    exit(1)
try:
    import json
except:
    print("JSON package not found.")
    exit(1)

try:
    import mysql
except:
    print("MySQL package not found.")
    exit(1)

try:
    from datetime import datetime
    import time
except:
    print("Datetime or Time not found.")
    exit(1)
```


##### Python Exception Handling Description

There are two exception handling in the python scripts. The python scripts altogether is designed not to fail as the user will not be touching the python script at all. There is an exception handling for database connection test check. If the database connection does not work, the exit signal will be triggered with another exit signal on the base file to help follow along the "thread" where error went wrong. We do have an exception handling that checks to see if the file or python packages exists or not when we attempt to import the files. If the files or python packages do not exist, the message is logged in terminal visible only to the developers. We have determined that it is not necessary for exception handling in python scripts to store the error messages to the error.log for the meantime.
